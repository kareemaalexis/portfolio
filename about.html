        <h1>All about me </h1>
        Well rounded, multi talented, and intelligent are a few words to describe my personality. To me, these are more than just words; they are the chracteristics that got me accepted into the Smash program. I first heard of this program through my highschool couselors because they knew one of the sight directors. At first, I was hestitant to submit my application because I wasnâ€™t quite interested in science as much as I was in math. When I gave it some thought, I decided to apply and suprisingly I got accepted weeks later. Although my future career is to be a lawyer or politician, I know that I can benefit from the Smash program and become well rounded in subjects besides English.
