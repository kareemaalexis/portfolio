            <h1> Kareema Chisolm </h1>
            Well rounded, multi talented, and intelligent are a few words to describe my personality. To me, these are more than just
            words; they are the chracteristics that got me accepted into the Smash program. I first heard of this program through my highschool couselors.  Although my future career is to be a lawyer orpolitician, I know that I can benefit from the Smash program and become well rounded in subjects besides English.
